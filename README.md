Quality RPG is a mod made for the PC game Tabletop Simulator.

QRPG is a project focused around building powerful tools to track and modify common RPG information. We want to enable Game Masters to run their game completely inside of TTS -- adding as much fanciness for the players and GMs as we can along the way.

We consider Quality RPG a collection of quality-of-life improvements that although are not a necessity to play RPGs in TTS, they certainly do make it easier.
